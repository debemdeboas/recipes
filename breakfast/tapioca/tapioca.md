# EASY TAPIOCA

This is a very, very basic tapioca recipe.
It's heavily encouraged that you adapt this recipe to your personal cooking style.
If you want to use a smaller pan, use less tapioca flour.
If you want more butter, grate more butter.
Try, fail, cook.

## Ingredients:

For the base layer:

- Five or six tablespoons of tapioca
- Butter

For the filling (but this can be anything you want - seriously, use your imagination):

- Strips of low-moisture mozzarella (or gruyere, or emmental...)
- Salami
- Fried egg

## The good bit

Fry a sunny-side-up egg. Reserve.

In a 20-25cm frying pan - or any pan with low, sloped edges - evenly distribute your tapioca flour, making sure that the bottom of the pan is not visible.
Gently and evenly grate some butter over your tapioca.
Never spread it!
Make it rain, baby.

Put your pan over a medium-low flame and keep an eye on the tapioca.
If the edges start to lift up before the 2-minute mark, lower your heat.
After two minutes, add some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and cheese.
Roughly tear your cheese and lay it over the tapioca in the pan for the heat to melt it as the tapioca cooks.

Lay your salami atop your cheese, and lay the egg on top of the salami bed.
When your tapioca starts to lift its edges from the pan, take a spatula and very carefully fold it closed like you would a taco.

Transfer into a plate and put some more grated butter on top for presentation.
Eat while it's still warm.

## Filling ideas

Some fillings that I absolutely adore and that you will probably love, too:

- Emmental cheese and red pepper jam for the most incredible sweet-and-savory experiences ever
- Nutella (that's it)
- Peanut butter and strawberry jam
